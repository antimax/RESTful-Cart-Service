Shopping cart RESTful service. Discover API navigating trough link resource relation links explained in the Hypertext Application Language (HAL)
specification: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html. Use HEAD instead of GET or GET + 'If-None-Matches' header to check whether a resource exists or to
validate a cached resource state.
